# Supporting IPython notebooks

These notebooks supplement the following research paper:

P. Juh√°s, C. L. Farrow, X. Yang, K. R. Knox and S. J. L. Billinge,
Complex Modeling: a strategy and software program for combining multiple
information sources to solve ill-posed structure and nanostructure inverse
problems, *Acta Cryst. A* **71** (2015),
[doi:10.1107/S2053273315014473](http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2053273315014473).

The notebooks are named according to the sections of the paper they
illustrate.  The notebooks can be opened and executed with IPython
provided that [DiffPy-CMI](http://www.diffpy.org/products/diffpycmi/)
has been installed.  Alternatively they can be also viewed online at
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pavoljuhas/nb2015-ACA-CMI.
